Car price estimation using Scikit-learn.

This project is intended for car price estimation based on polynomial regression. 

Project contents: 
1. Initially data sets with some car model. Additionally, in case of necessity, there is a parser retrieving general information from actual ads on the website www.auto.ru. 
2. Algorithm using polynomial regression for car price predictions. The features are 'age' and 'mileage'.
